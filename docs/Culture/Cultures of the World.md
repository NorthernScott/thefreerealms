## Introduction

Cultures in the Free Realms are based on the establishment of people group before, during, and after the [[Empire of Seven Houses|Sebeun Empire]]. All cultural groups in the world have been dramatically impacted by colonialism and even those that have coalesced around a pre-imperial identity are essentially reconstructionist in nature. Perhaps the most dramatic impact of the Empire is the amount of racial mixing that exists in the world. Races are widely distributed across the planet, and most cultural groups are multiracial.

## Sebeun Elves

Those who identify as "Sebeun" are essentially holdovers from a dead empire. The Sebeun are almost entirely High Elves (though a non-elf Sebeun could be an interesting character). Those who identify this way tend to be haughty, superior, traditional, and believe in eleven supremacy. Cultural touchstones are based on Imperial China.

## Kindred Elves

The Kindred were a sect of elves who split from what became the Sebeun over two millennia ago. They believe deeply in balance and respect for life. They have lived in total isolation on the continent of Polaris since the schism but in recent decades have started to send out emissaries alone and in pairs to find their former kin and to re-enter the world.

## Caraighnen

Racially mixed, Caraighnen are merchants and traders with a strong naval tradition. Tending toward neo-liberal values with strong capitalist tendencies. Culture touchstones are based on Renaissance Italy. Based in the city and republic of Caraighn.

## Druids

During the time of the Sebeun Empire, isolated groups of druids were some of the only peoples left both un-conquered and wielding magic. Neither arcane nor divine, their power comes from Creation and the culture seeks to live in harmony with the world. They played a key role in helping to end the tyranny and repression of the Empire and even today, several centuries on, they are still regarded with a somewhat mystical fascination. Since the fall of the empire, the druids have embarked on a campaign of healing the scars left by the empire's industry and magical experimentation. An interesting option would be a member of the druid culture who is not themselves a druid by class. Various ranger architypes could make an interesting choice here.

## Malagonian

The nation of Malaga was a nation divided and now largely dissolved. Seized by a sect of eco-radical druids after the Fall, the inhabitants of Malaga - a heavily industrialized and cosmopolitan land - were forced into enormous, cramped ghettos and kept under strict authoritarian laws, all in the name of "Balance." Since then, the druids of Malaga have largely completed their self-appointed task of restoring balance to the land and the great walled ghetto-cities have been left to rot or, in at least one case, destroyed.

### Malagonian Druids

A druid of this order could be either a fanatical authoritarian or a fanatical anti-authoritarian, or perhaps something in between. This druid culture insists on conformity, rigid obedience to hierarchy, and a fanatical devotion to the natural world at the expense of so-called "civilization."

### Malagonian Laity

A person who has grown up in the ruins of one of the ghettos. Lots of variability here, but likely wounded and traumatized to a degree.

## Corrverian

Often associated with the nation of Cobrith, Corrverians tend to be hale and hearty and also pious. Cobrith is one of the handful of nations that developed a national religion after the fall, largely based on the latent traditions of the corrverian people. Culture is based on Scandinavia. Religion is based on a kind of militant and good-hearted Catholicism, with the worship of Lathander -  the Mourning Lord - standing in place of Christ.

## Mergazi

Broadly middle eastern and South Asian, and I am working on making them more textured. The Mergazi people encompass a wide variety of races and dominant the bulk of the south central part of the continent of Ellas, which includes jungles, deserts, coasts, and everything in between.

## Bastillan

Thoughtful, intellectual, and highly varied, Bastilla is a place that would surprise most Caraighnen because in many ways it does "Caraighnen" better than the Caraighnen do. Culture is roughly based on late-Imperial Spain and Portugal. Centered in the nation of Bastilla but has spread north all along the south and central western coast of Ellas, where they mix with many other groups.

## Noreaster

A term of either affection or derision for the people of northeastern coast of the Sea of Sails, as well as for some of the rural folk of Northern Caraighn. Culture is based on the south coast of Newfoundland, Wales, and Southwestern England (think Cornwall and Devonshire) - hobbits, in essence.

## Timgadi

A culture of exclusively dwarves, the Timgadi were forcibly relocated by the Sebeun from their mountain homes in Southern Ellas to the west coast of the Sea of Sails to build and pilot the enormous cargo vessels that carried goods from the heart of Ellas back to the elves' home continent of Jjiang Ri. Culture is loosely based on the ancient Central Asian mounted tribes. Think Scythians, Kurgans, Huns, etc., but with boats in place of horses. Extremely clannish and deeply "dwarvish" in many respects, the Timgadi are traders when it suits them and pirates when it doesn't. They regard themselves as unparalleled seamen, although the Caraighnen would beg to differ. One thing is for sure, though. The container-ship sized cargo transports that they have converted into Dreadnoughts strike fear into the hearts of anyone they encounter, friend and foe alike.

## Venturi

Broadly describes the people of the Venturi Coast, the region to the east of the Malagon Range that runs from the forests of Malaga in the north to the forests and swamps of the south. In the days of the empire, the Venturi Coast was the most heavily industrialized part of the continent of Ellas, and also the part most firmly under the control of the Sebeun. Unfortunately, that meant that it suffered enormous devastation during the Cataclysm. The people of the Venturi Coast are still more cosmopolitan than most, though they have developed a somewhat hardy sense of self-reliance since then. A greater preponderance of elves and half-elves here than in many other places,. Their plains and open woodlands support a wide diversity of communities. Culturally based on Imperial France, but leaning more toward the peasants than to Versailles.

## Estrellan

About a century and a half ago, a movement began to "recover" the many good things that people felt they had lost with the fall of the empire. This rapidly became a movement to establish a "new" empire on the bones of the old - without, of course, the many faults of the past. Centered in the city of Estrella, one of the oldest metropolises on Ellas, this people group is as much a political class as it is an ethnic identity, though that is changing. These people are generally more open to authoritarianism.

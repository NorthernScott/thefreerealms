## Sale & Consumption

Majnun is most often sold in small, brittle cakes, usually about the size of a hockey puck and brick red in colour. Majnun is derived from the flowers of a common coastal plant the thrives in the salt marshes. In fact, the salt content of majnun is sufficiently high that it is sometimes used as a seasoning in food. Assuming the consumer is not otherwise inebriated, it's consumption in these quantities is not usually enough to have any psychotropic effects.

Majnun is usually smoked in a water pipe (a hookah, or bong), which blunts its effects somewhat. A more potent method of consumption is from a pipe, which tend to be extremely long, thin, and are often ornately carved in either wood or bone.

## Effects

Effects are felt in minutes, with mild exposure to majnun results in a gentle feeling of euphoria, or "high." This is often accompanied by increased appetite and somewhat heightened senses. For these reasons it is often considered a preferable social lubricant to alcohol, especially when doing business.

Moderate or heavy use generally results in a greater high, but also poor short-term memory, excessive sleepiness, feelings of dissociation, and dramatically altered perception of time. Unlike alcohol, there is no hangover.

## J'nunninn

J'nunninn, while not illegal, carries a substantial social stigma and is hard to find. Users, called "junni," tend to be destitute and desperate. J'nunninn is always a black, tar-like substance and is usually smoked from a pipe. The effects are not well documented but it has been said to induce as almost orgasmic feeling of euphoria with extreme increases in sensory perception. The effect is usually debilitating and leaves the user in a state of bliss for several hours. However, in approximately 1 in 3 users, the sensory overload seems to trigger a kind of psychosis. Victims of an overdose exhibit extreme volatility and usually aggression and violence. They seem to lose the ability to reason and attack anyone in the area. This had led to about a dozen deaths in recent months, both of j'nunninn users and their victims. In at least one case, a junni died of an apparent heart attack approximately 10 minutes after onset of symptoms.

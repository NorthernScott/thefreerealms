## Overview

Port Zug is the quintessential tourist town. Perched on the coast at the edge of the desert, the city sits at sea level and hosts a moderately sized port. Where many coastal cities act as trade hubs, Port Zug is supported principally by tourism. Prostitution, drinking, drugs, gambling, and gladiator fighting are all legal. While chattel slavery is officially frowned upon, the laws explicitly allow for contracted indentured servitude, and roughly two-thirds of the population are in fact slaves.

## Government

### Executive

Port Zug is nominally governed by a hereditary Patriarch, the Arshun - currently [[Arshun Ibn Abed Humaid el-Abed]], who rules with total authority. However, in actuality, the city is governed by a small conclave of sorcerers know as the *[[Maq'Sahir]]*. They are literally the power behind the throne, as a trusted member of the Maq'Sahir serves as Grand Vizir[^1] at all times. From their place at the Arshun's side, they can guide, cajole, influence, threaten, and otherwise direct almost all matters in the city.
[^1]: The Grand Vizier serves as, essentially, the chief civil servant of the city and also the head magistrate. This, in addition to their influence over the Arshun, makes the Grand Vizier easily the most powerful person in Port Zug.

??? danger "Spoilers"

	Unbeknownst to almost everyone, and especially to the Arshun. the Maq'Sahir are themselves governed by a group of four powerful genies - a Dao, a Djinn, an Efreet, and a Marid. Though rarely spoken of, those who know of them called them simply "[[Maq'Sahir#The Four|The Four]]."

### Legislative

A vestige of an earlier time and now largely ceremonial, the authority to make and unmake laws rests with *Al'Majli*, the People's Council. This body is made up of representatives from each neighbourhood or *Mintaqat* who are elected in popular votes. Both the elections and the council itself are largely regarded as something of a farce and closer to being a type of popular entertainment than any kind of real governance process. The simple truth is that the laws are set by the Maq'Sahir through the Arshun, and the Al'Majli simply passes them.

However, the Al'Majli does continue to play a role in local governance, as Councillors - *Maj* - often act as arbiters neighbourhood disputes and represent the requests of their constituency to the Arshun. They will sometimes also serve as advocates for their constituents before the court, though this practice varies depending on the personal inclinations of the Maj.

### Judiciary

The judicial system in Port Zug is simple, effective, and often controversial. A single court, The Court of the Grand Vizier, hears all cases. Any citizen can bring a case against any other citizen. While caste is theoretically not considered in the court process, those of higher caste are considered to have higher standing and their opinion generally holds greater weight.

The Court of the Grand Vizier is always presided over by either the Grand Vizier themself or, frequently, by an appointed magistrate. The court follows only basic rules of evidence and semi-elaborate rules of order that are somewhat flexible depending on the presiding magistrate. Judgments are usually handed down immediately following arguments and presentation of evidence, with punishments and sentences often carried out on the spot. Although petitioners can appeal to the Arshun, in practice the Arshun has not heard a case in over 12 years.

While such a system could be rife with corruption and primed for abuse, the Maq'Sahir understand that stability is key to their flourishing and make a concerted effort to deliver actual justice and at least the appearance of impartiality. It is purely this self-interested goodwill that ensures the court process is more than a showtrial.

## Culture

### Drugs & Alcohol

Recreational activities include a cornucopia of brothels, dune sled racing in the "Empty Quarter," gladiatorial combat, athletics contests (held nude at the arena), a sirprisingly large zoo, sailing races, eating contests, parties, orgies, drinking, and the consumption of a hashish-like drug called "[[Majnun]]." (A more potent and possibly adulterated form called "[[Majnun#j'nuninn|j'nunninn]]" has recently appeared and been associated with several deaths.)

## Slavery

Slavery (ibdi) is regarded as a kind of cherished local tradition. Far from chattel slavery, slaves (ibd/n) in Zug are essentially under contract. Their time as slaves is generally term limited, though lifetime contracts are allowed. Their rights are also protected under law, with guarantees placed on their safety and restrictions placed on their duties. A number of key points include:

- Slave contracts cannot be bought or sold, except by the slave themself.
- Slaves cannot be asked to perform any sexual acts except by mutual consent. While the vast majority of prostitutes are slaves in theory, at least, it is a type of service that they have chosen.
- Slaves are entitled to one major meal and three minor meals per day, as well as safe and "suitable" accommodations.

While the theory of slavery is largely positive and well-regulated, the practice is somewhat less so. In particular, the conditions in which slaves are kept can vary widely. Abuse and deprivation has become gradually more and more common, especially in recent decades as the Court of the High Vizier has tended to favour owners more and more. The sad truth is that while most slaves are still treated reasonably well, more and more are finding themselves in precarious circumstances.

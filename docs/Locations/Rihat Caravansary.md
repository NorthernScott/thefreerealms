The Rihat Caravansary is a walled desert inn of the [[Ashur-Nirari]] culture. Located on a hillock next to the banks of the Zda Eil River, Rihat is one of the more important trade stops in the centre of the [Ssibilene Desert](https://www.worldanvil.com/w/the-free-realms-northernscott/a/ssibilene-desert-location?preview=true). As of 893 FA, The "governor" of Rihat is a demi-halfling named [Eku’ r Zakir](https://www.worldanvil.com/w/the-free-realms-northernscott/a/ekuE28099-r-zakir-person?preview=true). Capable of supporting several hundred visitors and their camels, Rihat draws water from a large well. Those who do not wish to pay for the well water are welcome to walk to the nearby riverbank and collect water themselves. Due to its proximity to abundant water, Rihat is able to grow a small amount of food both within its walls and along the banks. It also houses a small but surprisingly opulent bath house.

The permanent population of Rihat is entirely halfling of the Ashur-Nirari society.

*Adapted from [14 Common Character Archetypes You Should Know (dabblewriter.com)](https://www.dabblewriter.com/articles/character-archetypes)*

When first building a character, it's easy to think that they have to be the most unique character ever created, but this isn't true. There is nothing wrong with taking inspiration from movies, plays, literature, and mythology. There is a reason why many of the most familiar character archetypes appear over and over again: they are compelling, complex, and make for good stories. Archetypes can be a useful foundation on which to build characters that are unique and reflective of you.

## What is an archetype?

Archetypes are like classes or templates of characters that make use of common experiences, traits, and actions to make them recognizable to most people, no matter where you are from. 
Archetypes tell a universal truth that transcends time, geography, culture, and many of the differences that people experience. They are a common thread among the human experience, and this familiarity can be incredibly strong. Another option is to subvert and/or mix archetypes. This can be a great way to add complexity and surprise while still working from a solid foundation. 

A couple of pitfalls: Clichés are similar to archetypes but are familiar, common, and overdone. They are predictable and don't lend themselves to depth. What about stereotypes? While archetypes are relatable because of a common human experience, stereotypes instead play to unfounded preconceptions and oversimplifications. While stereotypes can be positive, they are often negative, false, and offensive.

##  The Caregiver

The Caregiver is someone who selflessly and wholeheartedly supports those around them, often at their own expense. This archetype can be a parent, best friend, partner, teacher, mentor, guardian, sibling, etc.

‍**Traits:** Compassionate, loving, caring, selfless, loyal, honorable, consistent

‍**Pitfalls:** Too selfless, vulnerable from giving too much, lack of personal goals or growth

‍**Story Hooks:** Maybe your Caregiver has been supporting a very unsympathetic person. They might be exploited to the point where they have become bitter or broken. The Caregiver could also be caring for another player character or a significant NPC.

‍**Examples:** Hagrid (_Harry Potter_), Samwise Gamgee (_Lord of the Rings_), Mrs. Potts (_Beauty and the Beast_)

## The Common Person /  The Everyman

The Common Person is the average, unexceptional, and everyday person thrust into circumstances beyond their control and given the opportunity to become a hero. They likely have a profession - often a trade - and could be very salt-of-the-earth.

‍**Traits:** Empathetic, hard-working, kind, virtuous, accepting, belonging, grounded, relatable

‍**Pitfalls:** Lack of power or uniqueness, unprepared

‍**Story Hooks:** What has drawn them from their everyday life into a heroic narrative? Are they an innocent naïf, or maybe not as innocent as they might seem? 

**Examples:** Bilbo Baggins (_Lord of the Rings_), Ron Weasley (_Harry Potter_), Anastasia (_Anastasia_), Leslie Knope (_Parks & Recreation_)

## The Creator

The Creator isn’t happy unless they are making or building something, usually working towards a single creation that consumes their every thought. They are compelled to always push the limits and leave a legacy. To the Creator, there is nothing that is more important than what they are trying to make, and they are willing to sacrifice themselves and others to reach their goal.

‍**Traits:** Obsessive, imaginative, creative, driven, strong-willed, non-conforming

‍**Pitfalls:** Single-minded, perfectionist, selfish, unreliable, egotistical, willing to sacrifice themselves or others

‍**Story Hooks:** Perhaps the Creator is on a journey to find some knowledge or resource required to complete their creation. Perhaps their creation has gone horribly wrong. Because of their single-minded focus, creators are perhaps well suited to being "evil," and may come into conflict over achieving their goal at the expense of others. Also, keep in mind, that a Creator should be able to make their obsession seem reasonable, at least to them.

**Examples:** Dr. Victor Frankenstein (_Frankenstein_), Alexander Hamilton (_Hamilton_), half the villains in superhero movies

## The Explorer

Explorers are always pushing boundaries. Those boundaries might be physical ones—going beyond where they should—or unseen ones in society or themselves. They feel confined in their daily lives and are dissatisfied with leading a "normal" life.

‍**Traits:** Courageous, independent, nonconforming, driven, curious

‍**Pitfalls:** Never satisfied, aimless, alienated and self-alienating, selfish

‍**Story Hooks:** Is your Explorer motivated by something intrinsic to themselves, or have they been shaped into this person by an external force? Do they have an overriding goal or an image that they are aspiring to match?

‍**Examples:** Ariel (_The Little Mermaid_), Moana (_Moana_), Captain Kirk (_Star Trek_)

## The Hero / The Reluctant Hero

While all characters in D&D can be heroic, not all characters are examples of The Hero archetype. That's because the Hero is defined by their Quest. The Hero is a character who has identified a challenge and sets out to conquer it. It's important to recognize that the Hero can be either classic or reluctant - eager for the fight or resigned to their fate.

‍**Traits:** Strong, persistent, courageous, honorable, stands up for those who can’t stand up for themselves

‍**Pitfalls:** Arrogance and hubris

‍**Story Hooks:** First and foremost, a hero needs a quest. What is their quest and what is their attitude toward it? Are they eager, reluctant, or are their feelings more complicated? How did they receive their quest? Did they take it on by choice or was it given to them by someone else?

‍**Examples:** Frodo Baggins (_The Lord of the Rings_), Harry Potter (_Harry Potter_), Captain Marvel (_Marvel_)

## The Innocent

Defined by their unending optimism and naivety, the Innocent is morally pure in action and intent. They usually start from a good, comfortable place until a singular event radically alters their world, opening their eyes to a reality that was either blissfully ignored before or did not impact them until now.

**Traits:** Honest, trusting, enthusiastic, open, caring, loving, sincere

‍**Pitfalls:** Naïve, too trusting, unskilled or powerless, inexperienced, unaware, vulnerable

‍**Story Hooks:** The Innocent is usually a starting point of a character. They are someone who grows and changes throughout their journey. You should give thought to the ways in which they might grow and develop as they gain wisdom and experience. 

‍**Examples:** Scout (_To Kill a Mockingbird_), Merry and Pippen (_Lord of the Rings_), Rapunzel (_Tangled_)

## The Joker/Jester

The Joker or Jester is someone who can be either  pure comic relief,  or they can use humor to shine a light on some sort of issue. They are funny, either intentionally or unintentionally so. Classically, they live in the moment, don't plan ahead, and have a very casual attitude. However, these things may be covers for much more depth and wisdom. They often march to the beat of their own drum and are proud of it.

‍**Traits:** Fun-loving, humorous, likeable, surprisingly insightful

‍**Pitfalls:** Superficial, obnoxious, impulsive

**Story Hooks:** It's easy for Jokers to become one-dimensional, but this can be combated by giving them something to care about. If their usual attitude is to be carefree, then it's good for them to have something for which they are care-full.

‍**Examples:** Fat Amy (_Pitch Perfect_), Harley Quinn (_DC Comics_), Dory (_Finding Nemo_), Tomi Leagallows (_Neverwinter Nights_)

## The Lover

Guided by their heart and emotions, the Lover is a character that can range from hopeless romantics to playboys. They will often change or sacrifice themselves in the pursuit of acquiring or maintaining love. To them, the person or thing that they love is the most important thing in their life, similar to the Creator and their creation. Lovers can often become tragic figures because of the all-consuming nature of their affection.

‍**Traits:** Devoted, compassionate, caring, protective

‍**Pitfalls:** Obsessive, willingness to sacrifice themselves, scared of loneliness, jealousy, lack of own identity

‍**Story Hooks:** Lovers don't necessarily have to be consumed by romantic or sexual love. They could be devoted to love of friends or family, and fill a role similar to the Caregiver. Consider the motivation behind their love and devotion, and whether it has or could slip into obsession. What would happen if the object of their love was dead, unavailable, or actively hostile to them?

‍**Examples:** Romeo and Juliet (_Romeo and Juliet_), Edward Cullen (_Twilight_)

## The Magician

Not necessarily someone who wields literal magic, the Magician is someone so skilled that it almost seems inhuman. They are also on a search for power - first and foremost for themselves rather than for others. Power could be knowledge, political capital, wealth, physical or mental strength, etc. Magicians have an abundance of their power and strive for more.

‍**Traits:** Intelligent, powerful, disciplined, omniscient and/or omnipotent, intuitive, perceptive, clever

‍**Pitfalls:** Arrogance, hubris, selfishness

‍**Story Hooks:** The Magician is an archetype that can apply equally to both heroes and villains. 
This doesn’t mean they must be good or bad, but all Magicians continually seek _more_. Key to the Magician is what power they seek and why.

‍**Examples:** Hermoine Granger (_Harry Potter_), Doctor Strange (_Marvel_), Regina George (_Mean Girls_)

## The Orphan

It's a cliché that every character in D&D is an orphan, but whether they are an actual orphan or not, all characters are not examples of the Orphan. The Orphan is a character who is taken from a state of unimportance or poverty and dropped into one of excitement or grandeur. Orphans are also looking for a group to belong to: a family in lieu of the family they never had or have lost.

‍**Traits:** Survivalists, empathetic, determined, driven

‍**Pitfalls:** Lack of access to resources, underdeveloped from their isolation, unconfident

**Story Hooks:** Orphan can easily fall into the “Chosen One” cliché. The key is to give detail and texture to their backstory and their yearning. Also, like the Innocent, the Orphan is a character with growth at their centre. Consider how they might change over the course of the story.

‍**Examples:** Simba (_The Lion King_), Harry Potter (_Harry Potter_), Annie (_Little Orphan Annie_)

## The Rebel

When society is broken, the Rebel leads the charge against flawed leaders and power structures. Characters who fall under this archetype are unapologetically themselves and inspire others to join them. More than anything, the Rebel wants change and nothing will stop them.

‍**Traits:** Natural leaders, courageous, inspiring, strong, charismatic, virtuous, resourceful

‍**Pitfalls:** Obsessed with their goals, uncompromising, lacking resources and means of power, lawbreaker, fanatic

‍**Story Hooks:** Rebels without flaws become the Perfect Bad Boy (tm) cliché. Consider their flaws and make the flaws more than just cosmetic. Also, consider how committed they are to their cause. A Rebel without conviction could become a kind of Reluctant Hero, and a Rebel with too much conviction could veer in the direction of a Creator or a Magician and potentially become an evil character.

‍**Examples:** Robin Hood (_Robin Hood_), Han Solo (_Star Wars_), Katniss Everdeen (_The Hunger Games_)

## The Ruler

The Ruler is in charge, either through legal, emotional, or military means. They are responsible for others—from one person to a kingdom—and can be compassionate or autocratic. The biggest fear for a Ruler is some sort of threat to their control that can force them to lose their power or cause harm to those they are protecting.

‍**Traits:** Powerful, stable, high status, access to resources, charismatic

‍**Pitfalls:** Controlling, out of touch, disliked, many enemies, greedy, fear of losing their position/status

‍**Story Hooks:** In a D&D campaign, the Ruler has to have a very good reason to leave their sphere of responsibility and power, and set out on an adventure. What has driven them out onto the road and how has this impacted their "subjects."

‍**Examples:** Nurse Ratched (_One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest_), Mufasa (_The Lion King_), Peter Pan (_Peter Pan_), The Queen of Hearts (_Alice in Wonderland_)

## The Sage

The Sage, also known as the Mentor, is similar to the Magician in many ways but has different motivations. Whereas the Magician wants to further themselves—whether for malicious reasons or not—the Sage wants to help out. They are powerful or knowledgeable like the Magician, but Sages are the ones who pass their knowledge to a pupil.

‍**Traits:** Wise, caring, patient, insightful, rational

‍**Pitfalls:** Passive, cautious, arrogant, isolated

‍**Story Hooks:** In the context of a D&D campaign, a Sage could be a character who grows from novice to master. Consider that even the greatest masters have to start somewhere, and then consider what that person might be like as a younger version of themselves. The Sage's journey may be very much internal: overcoming their own demons or flaws to become the person they envision themselves to be.

‍**Examples:** Professor McGonagall and Dumbledore (_Harry Potter_), Gandalf (_Lord of the Rings_), Hannibal Lecter (_Silence of the Lambs_), Obi-Wan Kenobi (_Star Wars_), The Ancient One (_Doctor Strange_)

## The Seductor

We tend to see Seductors from the outside and to categorize them as villains. They are people who use what they have to get what they want. But consider the Seductor from their own perspective. They are a person who has something that everyone else wants, whether that is their power, their wit, their body, or something else. From their perspective, they are the focus of constant (unwanted?) demands and attention. Perhaps they have learned to leverage that attention for their own gains, but even if they have, can you blame them?

‍**Traits:** Manipulative, charismatic, amoral, independent, clever, survivor

‍**Pitfalls:** Isolated, unfulfilled (even if they don’t know it), standoffish, selfish

‍**Story Hooks:** We think we know the Seductor - they are the person who is beautiful / sexy / rich / whatever. But that's a utilitarian view that objectifies them. The interesting questions are: what do _they_ want, and how do they feel about all this attention?

‍**Examples:** Black Widow (_Marvel_), Mystique (_X-Men_), Lucifer (_Supernatural_)

This worksheet is intended to help with ideation for settlements of all sizes. See the [[Settlement Template]] to layout and format settlement articles.

*Adapted from [Lazeerlow's Actionable City and Town Template (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/ijjj2c/lazeerlows_actionable_city_and_town_template/), with additions from Dael Kingsmill's excellent ["SPERM" model for settlement creation](https://youtu.be/sJd6g--Ok_A?t=105).*

**Name(s):** What is the settlement called?
**Region / Location:** What region is the settlement in?
**Size:** How big is the settlement (Tiny Village --> to Huge City)?

## 3 Unique Things
*These don’t have to be fantastical, although they often are. These should be relevant and impactful, shaping not only how the town functions but also the experiences that the players have there.* 

1. A quality, feature, or location that only this place has.
2. A quality, feature, or location that only this place has.
3. A quality, feature, or location that only this place has.

## Districts
*A district is a group of important locations that the party might visit that includes at least three locales. District definitions should focus on locations that you believe the players might go to. Each settlement should have at least 3 districts but no more than 12.*

*For each Location of Interest add about 3 details to give the location texture. Think especially about the purpose of the location, the people who populate it, and **how it relates to your players.***

## Wilderness Locales

Settlements do not exist in a vacuum - surrounding regions provide context and also sources of adventure. Start with a simple description, then add something about it that makes it interesting or unique. Provide an explanation for why the locale hasn’t already been explored, plundered, or claimed. Finally, give the locale something about it that draws the attention of the players. The hook will depend on your players, but the need for a hook is universal.

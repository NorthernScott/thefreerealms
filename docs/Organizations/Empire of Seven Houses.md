Centered on the 일곱 도시 (Ilgob Dosi) – the Seven Cities – the Sebeun Empire, 세븐 하우스 제극 (Sebeun Hauseu Jegug), controlled most of Milas from their base on 끼앙리 (Jjiang-Ri) for the entirety of the Third Age. After solidifying their control of Jjiang-Ri, the elves rapidly expanded their territory into Corrveria and, somewhat later, Ellas. They accomplished their conquests by a variety of means including subterfuge and direct conflict. However, their preferred method of annexation was to station an overwhelming military presence on the border of some desired territory, then “treat” with that territory under threat of destruction. Many territories came under their sway voluntarily, and some even eagerly accepted their offers of peace, order, and prosperity. By the thirteenth century of the third age the Sebeun controlled most of Milas (though it would take until 2983 TA for the Lords to proclaim the “Completion of the Empire”). At the time, attitudes toward the empire were largely positive. The massive increase in trade drove new wealth, and the elves’ magical crafts made possible wonders that had previously been only dreams. The empire and its citizens grew powerful and prosperous.

## Introduction

The Tiger is the armed forces of the [[Caraighn|Republic of Caraighn]], responsible for the protection of the Republic and the expansion of her territory and influence, the defence of her fleets and merchants, and the furtherance of her aims. The Tiger is also the only police force of the Republic and is responsible for enforcing laws and keeping the peace.

Established 292 FA, the Tiger was originally a militia created by the Twelve Noble Houses, using their funds and their retainers, to put down what they called the "Peasant Revolt" and what others call the Caraighnen Civil War. It has since become a formal organ of the state and is sustained in part by public taxes. However, all of the noble houses of Caraighn still pay into it, with the Twelve paying the most, and its officer ranks are heavily staffed by the younger sons and daughters of Caraighnen nobility, with disputes between houses sometimes manifesting as divisional rivalries.

### Claws

The Tiger is broken up into four major divisions, called Claws.

**Red Claw:** The army, responsible for protection of the countryside, standard military functions, and foreign campaigns.

**Blue Claw:** The navy, responsible for the protection of Caraighnen waters, defence of her merchant fleets, and naval campaigns.

**Purple Claw:** Much smaller than either the red or blue claws, the Purple Claw is comprised of elite units tasked with the protection of the Duke/Duchess, the Council, and the organs of the state. It is also sometimes used to carry out special forces missions distinct from open military action. Similar in concept to the Praetorian Guard or the Swiss Guard, but also with very secretive elements similar to the U.S. Army Rangers or the U.S. Navy Seals. The Purple Claw operates on land and sea, however required. It is often viewed as arrogant and elitist, but also dangerous and effective.

**Orange Claw:** Responsible for law enforcement throughout the Republic. Units are organized into Detachments who have responsibility for a given geographical area, such as a neighbourhood of a large city, a town, or a rural area. Typically seen by members of the other claws as “less than” and “not real soldiers,” the men and women of the Orange Claw are regarded reasonably warmly by most citizens and have a reputation for effectiveness, fairness, and even kindness. In some respects, they embody the best of “community policing,” though this varies from detachment to detachment and from commander to commander.

	**Black Claw:** There is also a fifth claw whose very existence is known to only
	a handful of people - the _Black Claw_. It’s questionable whether even the entire Council of Twelve knows of the Black Claw. The Black Claw is the secret service of the Tiger. It is responsible for four areas of operations:
	
	1. Foreign Intelligence
	2. Domestic Intelligence
	3. Counter Intelligence
	4. Covert Operations
	
	The Black Claw is much smaller than the other units and unknown to all regular troops and most high ranking officers. When they must interact with other parts of the Dragon or in public they often masquerade as high ranking military officers of other claws, mostly the Purple Claw. In general, however, they stay in the shadows and regard a job that stays secret as a job well done.

### Units

The following unit designations apply to the Red, Blue, and Orange claws. Purple Claw ranks mirror the Red and Blue Claws, dependent on service area. The minimum rank of the commanding officer and unit size ranges are provided below the unit names. Both may vary depending on unit staffing.

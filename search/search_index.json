Archetypes tell a universal truth that transcends time, geography, culture, and many of the differences that people experience. They are a common thread among the human experience, and this familiarity can be incredibly strong. Another option is to subvert and/or mix archetypes. This can be a great way to add complexity and surprise while still working from a solid foundation. </p> <p>A couple of pitfalls: Clich\u00e9s are similar to archetypes but are familiar, common, and overdone. They are predictable and don't lend themselves to depth. What about stereotypes? While archetypes are relatable because of a common human experience, stereotypes instead play to unfounded preconceptions and oversimplifications.

After solidifying their control of Jjiang-Ri, the elves rapidly expanded their territory into Corrveria and, somewhat later, Ellas. They accomplished their conquests by a variety of means including subterfuge and direct conflict. However, their preferred method of annexation was to station an overwhelming military presence on the border of some desired territory, then \u201ctreat\u201d with that territory under threat of destruction. Many territories came under their sway voluntarily, and some even eagerly accepted their offers of peace, order, and prosperity.\u00a0By the thirteenth century of the third age the Sebeun controlled most of Milas (though it would take until 2983 TA for the Lords to proclaim the \u201cCompletion of the Empire\u201d). At the time, attitudes toward the empire were largely positive. The massive increase in trade drove new wealth, and the elves\u2019 magical crafts made possible wonders that had previously been only dreams.

It is also sometimes used to carry out special forces missions distinct from open military action. Similar in concept to the Praetorian Guard or the Swiss Guard, but also with very secretive elements similar to the U.S. Army Rangers or the U.S. Navy Seals. The Purple Claw operates on land and sea, however required. It is often viewed as arrogant and elitist, but also dangerous and effective.</p> <p>Orange Claw:\u00a0Responsible for law enforcement throughout the Republic. Units are organized into Detachments who have responsibility for a given geographical area, such as a neighbourhood of a large city, a town, or a rural area. Typically seen by members of the other claws as \u201cless than\u201d and \u201cnot real soldiers,\u201d the men and women of the Orange Claw are regarded reasonably warmly by most citizens and have a reputation for effectiveness, fairness, and even kindness.

When they must interact with other parts of the Dragon or in public they often masquerade as high ranking military officers of other claws, mostly the Purple Claw.
